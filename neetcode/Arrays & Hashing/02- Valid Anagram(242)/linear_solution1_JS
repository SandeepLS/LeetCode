/*
Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.
An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.
Example 1:
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false

Constraints:
1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 104
s and t consist of lowercase English letters.

Using HashMap:- two anagram(S, T)
 s     T
a 3   a 3
n 1   n 1
g 1   g 1
r 1   r 1
